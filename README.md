## Overview

This project was the first of my time at General Assembly, being set only three weeks in and two after the start of our Javascript module. Due to the Christmas holidays I had an extended deadline for this project so I decided to create a portal hub for a couple of different games. I ended up finishing three games: Tetris, FL-Tron and Frogger. They all live on a single home page with a leaderboard using local storage to store the scores.

Tetris is a puzzle game where blocks of varying shapes fall from the top of the board and it is the players goal to direct and place them in such a way as to create complete rows of blocks. Tetris is a one player game where the game speeds up as certain score thresholds and the aim is simply to last as long and rack up as many points as possible.

FL-Tron is a multiplayer snake variant where the goal is to defeat your enemies by causing them to run into your own snake body or run into a wall. Unlike traditional snake, the grid divisions are far smaller and the trail of the player is left behind instead of following.

Frogger is another classic arcade game where you play as a frog attempting to cross the road and river to reach a lilypad. The challange comes from trying to avoid the various cars and dangerous flow of the river that stand in your way.
